if you want to use another password file or socks5.txt(proxy file) , just go to your directory in which you git cloned this repo and paste there your choosen password file but name of file should be password.txt and if you also want to change proxy file same thing you have to do but this time file name should be socks.txt. I means password file name (password.txt) and proxy file name (socks5.txt).
